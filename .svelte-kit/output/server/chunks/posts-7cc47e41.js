<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I work as a frontend-engineer and mostly use <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> at work. I was looking for a different frontend framework that <strong>dose not</strong> use Virtual DOM to have more diverse skills under my belt.</p>
<p>I was always curious about <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and heard actually a lot of good things about it from people around me.</p>
<p>So I tried it out.</p>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p>There are already many posts about <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> by other people and reading the official document should be enough to start making stuff with it.</p>
<p>The syntax was very straightforward and I liked it a lot.</p>
<h2>Sveltekit</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">official document</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Vite</h2>
<p>Sveltekit internally uses <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> as its build tool.</p>
<p>This surely provided the <code>faster and leaner</code> experince they promised. The <code>HMR</code> was absolutely instantaneous.</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>I also tried <a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a> to host this blog. Hosting was extremely simple and easy. Setting the custom domain also was easy. Probably the best hosting service I've used so far.</p>
<h2>Other stuff</h2>
<p>I made a <a href="https://github.com/K-Sato1995/md-to-json-converter">package</a> that converts markdown files into JSON for this.</p>
